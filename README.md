### About the project
Go Journal is a basic command-line interface (CLI) tool focused on Journaling. The CLI currently supports two main flags:
- `go-journal --retrieve-all`: Retrieves all of your Journal entries
- `go-journal --create-new`: Allows to add a new Journal entry

I intend to leave a working binary in the repo when finished. Also, there might be some other options to implement.

### Learning path
Coming from a Python background, I find Go's syntax initially a bit unfamiliar, but it's simple enough to grasp the basics quickly. Also, the language feels somewhat verbose, leading me to repeat the same patterns multiple times. While this might be cumbersome in larger projects, it has helped me to understand Go's overall programming style.
